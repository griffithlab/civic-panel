"ERBB2","AMPLIFICATION","N/A","Transcript Amplification","Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.","17",37856333,37884915,,,,"GRCh37"
"BRAF","V600E","N/A","Missense Variant","BRAF V600E has been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types. It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.","7",140453136,140453136,,,,"GRCh37"
"IDH1","R132","N/A","Protein Altering Variant","IDH1 R132 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, and appear to behave quite differently in different environments. In myelodysplastic syndromes, IDH1 R132 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with the specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.","2",209113111,209113113,,,,"GRCh37"
"IDH2","R172","N/A","Protein Altering Variant","IDH2 R172 is a gain-of-function mutation commonly observed in acute myeloid leukemia and is enriched in those patients which are cytogenetically normal. R172 is analogous to IDH1 R132 mutations and leads to neomorphic enzymatic activity. Specifically this mutation ""catalyzes the conversion of alpha ketoglurarate to beta-hydrozyglutarate"" leading to increased levels of beta-hydrozyglutarate. This in turn leads to hypermethylation of target genes and an inhibition of cellular differentiation. R172 mutations generally lead to worse overall survival and higher rates of relapse compared to the most common IDH2 mutations in AML (R140).","15",90631837,90631839,,,,"GRCh37"

"NRAS","Q61","N/A","Missense Variant","NRAS Q61 mutations have been found in multiple myeloma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, melanoma, and others. Two melanoma patients, each harboring mutations at this locus (Q61L and Q61R), responded to treatment with the akylating agent temozolomide. However, in colorectal cancer patients, mutations at this locus have been shown to confer resistance to cetuximab. The prognostic impact of mutations at this locus is currently under study.","1",115256528,115256530,,,,"GRCh37"
"BRAF","V600","Other V600's","Protein Altering Variant","BRAF mutations of the valine 600 residue have been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types. Of the V600 mutations, V600E is the most widely researched. V600 mutations as a whole have been correlated to poorer prognosis in colorectal and papilarry thyroid cancers. V600 mutations have also been shown to confer sensitivity to the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. For a more detailed summary, click the individual mutations.","7",140453136,140453137,,,,"GRCh37"
"BRCA1","LOSS-OF-FUNCTION","BRCA Germline Variants","Loss Of Function Variant, Loss Of Heterozygosity","BRCA1 loss of function mutations have been shown to increase risk of breast and ovarian cancer in those carrying the allele in their germline. Treating BRCA mutant patients with PARP inhibitors such as Olaparib has led to significant response.","17",41196312,41277387,,,,"GRCh37"
"KRAS","G12/G13","N/A","Protein Altering Variant","While the KRAS G12 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still debated. Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a cohort of colorectal patients.","12",25398280,25398285,,,,"GRCh37"
"FLT3","TKD MUTATION","N/A","Nonsynonymous Variant","FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutations (FLT3-TKD) are much less common than FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplication) mutations and may not confer the same prognostic impact. Although the majority of mutations are point mutations effecting D835 (most frequently D835Y), a small proportion involve an in-frame deletion of I836. These mutations are within the activation loop of the second tyrosine kinase domain of FLT3 and thought to result in constitutive activation of the receptor.","13",28592642,28592642,,,,"GRCh37"
"DNMT3A","MUTATION","N/A","Transcript Variant","DNMT3A mutations occur in a variety of myeloid malignancies. These mutations are associated with adverse prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in the context of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations, which often co-occur. Early results indicate AML patients with DNMT3A mutations may respond better to decitabine than those with wild-type. Shorter survival has been indicated in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, however, larger cohorts are required to verify this finding. DNMT3A mutations have been suggested as a pre-leukemic lesion and found in older individuals with clonal hematopoiesis but no overt malignancy.","2",25455845,25565459,,,,"GRCh37"
"KIT","EXON 9 MUTATION","N/A","Exon Variant","In patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), imatinib has improved outcomes for patients with KIT mutations. However, acquired resistance to imatinib is common. Patients harboring exon 9 KIT mutations may benefit from higher imatinib doses (800mg/daily). Similarly, imatinib-refractory tumors showed sensitivity to sunitinib treatment. Improved responses to either treatment were not observed in patients with exon 11 mutations.","4",55592023,55592216,,,,"GRCh37"
"PIK3CA","MUTATION","N/A","Gain Of Function Variant, Transcript Variant","PIK3CA mutations are observed in many cancers among the most prevalent are breast cancer,  colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. These mutations have been observed in up to 40%, 20%, and 21% respectively for each of these cancer types with mutations commonly occurring within the helical exon 9 and kinase domain of exon 20. In breast cancer PIK3CA mutations have been associated with better prognosis, and a greater survival outcome, however the PI3K pathway is also associated with increased drug resistance (trastuzumab/lapatinib). PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and mutations in exon 9 and 20 are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC. Interestingly PIK3CA mutations in HNSCC have been observed to be absent from a number of ethnic groups including greek, german, and vietnamese populations.","3",178866311,178957881,"",,,"GRCh37"

"EGFR","EXON 19 DELETION","N/A","Inframe Deletion","Deletions within exon 19 of EGFR are most common in lung cancer. These deletions, in non-small cell lung cancer, have been shown to be sensitive to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib, afatinib, and erlotinib. There is also data to suggest that this event is a good prognostic marker in lung adenocarcinoma.","7",55242415,55242513,,,,"GRCh37"
"FLT3","ITD","N/A","Inframe Insertion","FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) frequently occur in patients with hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, but particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.","13",28608219,28608351,,,,"GRCh37"
"WT1","EXON 7 MUTATION","N/A","Exon Variant","WT1 exon 7 mutations have been shown to be recurrent in acute myeloid leukemia. Many sources have examined the prognostic impact of these, agreeing that the mutant exon 7 cohort is correlated with worse overall survival and a number of poor prognistic outcomes. This may be the result of an overall poor response to chemotherapy from WT1 mutant tumors.","11",32417803,32417953,,,,"GRCh37"
"FGFR1","AMPLIFICATION","N/A","Transcript Amplification","FGFR1 amplifications are the most common aberrations of the FGFR family in cancer. One study reports FGFR1 aberrations in 3.5% of 4,853 patients of which most are FGFR1 amplifications (Helsten et. al., 2016). Preclinically, FGFR1 amplifications have also been shown to confer sensitivity to FGFR1 inhibitors (Weiss et. al., 2010). Clinical studies are currently ongoing (e.g. NCT01004224).","8",38268656,38325363,,,,"GRCh37"
"TET2","MUTATION","N/A","Gene Variant, Loss Of Function Variant","TET2 mutations are commonly found in acute myeloid leukemia occurring in 9-23% of cases with many occurring in the elderly. Generally these mutations are loss-of-function which have been shown in mouse models to impair hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and cause aberrant hematopoiesis. These mutations have been found to be mutually exclusive with MLL and IDH1/2 mutations and have been associated with shortened event-free-survival and disease-free-survival when co-occurring with NPM1+/FLT3- genotypes. Overall Survival has been found to be shorter when occurring with NPM1+/FLT3+ genotypes. Studies involving ""CN AML"" and ""de novo AML"" however have been unable to elucidate a clinical impact.","4",106067450,106200973,,,,"GRCh37"
"EGFR","T790M","EGFR TKI Resistance","Missense Variant","EGFR T790M was one of the very first mutations recognized to confer resistance to targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer. While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.","7",55249071,55249071,,,,"GRCh37"
"ABL1","BCR-ABL T315I","Imatinib Resistance","Transcript Fusion, Missense Variant","While the efficacy of imatinib has revolutionized chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treatment, it is still not a cure-all. Both initial resistance and acquired resistance as a result of selection have been seen in a small subset of CML patients. The ABL kinase domain mutation T315I (aka T334I) has been shown to be one such mutation that confers resistance to imatinib. Second generation TKI's (dasatinib and ponatinib) specific to BCR-ABL have shown efficacy in treating resistant cases.","9",133748283,133748283,,,,"GRCh37"
"KRAS","G12D","EGFR TKI Resistance","Missense Variant","While the KRAS G12 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still actively debated. Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a single cohort of colorectal patients with G12D mutations. Overall, the interpretation for KRAS mutations in most clinical scenarios is still undecided.","12",25398284,25398284,,,,"GRCh37"
"EGFR","L858R","N/A","Missense Variant","EGFR L858R has long been recognized as a functionally significant mutation in cancer, and is one of the most prevalent single mutations in lung cancer. Best described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the mutation seems to confer sensitivity to first and second generation TKI's like gefitinib and neratinib. NSCLC patients with this mutation treated with TKI's show increased overall and progression-free survival, as compared to chemotherapy alone. Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.","7",55259515,55259515,,,,"GRCh37"
"DNMT3A","R882","N/A","Missense Variant","DNMT3A R882 mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) with R882H as the most common form. Mutations in DNMT3A have largely been associated with poorer prognosis, however this is not consistent across all studies. This may be a result of patient age or combining R882 and non-R882 mutations during analysis as studies have indicated independent mechanisms of action and differential prognostic implications for these mutation types. One study that independently analyzed R882 and non-R882 mutations showed R882 mutations were associated with poorer prognosis than patients with wildtype and non-R882 mutations, but only in older patients with AML.","2",25457241,25457243,,,,"GRCh37"

"NPM1","EXON 12 MUTATION","NPM1 Exon 12","Exon Variant","NPM1 exon 12 mutations are frequently identified in patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and often co-occur with FLT3-ITD. FLT3 status should also be evaluated as co-occurence with FLT3-ITD may impact prognosis. Exon 12 mutations have been identified as a predictor of good prognostic outcomes in the absence of FLT3-ITD. Due to their high frequency, NPM1 mutations have been retrospectively analyzed in the context of a number of therapies including variable results following ATRA treatment as well as improved response to high-dose daunorubicin or valproic acid. Additionally, multiple groups have shown increased surface expression of CD33 associated with NPM1 mutation, suggesting these patients may respond to anti-CD33 therapy. Cytoplasmic sequestration of NPM1 (NPM1c) is associated with a good response to induction therapy.","5",170837531,170837569,,,,"GRCh37"
