What is OpenCAP?



The Open-sourced CIViC Annotation Pipeline (OpenCAP) is a tutorial that provides users with a method to develop a customized capture panel for which the variants contained within the panel are linked to clinical relevance summaries in the CIViC knowledgebase. This tutorial contains four chapters:

- **Build custom capture panel**: Use the CIViC API to identify variants of interest within the database and design capture probes to target these variants.
- **Sequence samples**: Prospectively employ custom capture reagents on tumor samples for enriched capture of variants of interest.
- **Identify somatic variants**: Call variants from tumor-normal sequencing data.
- **Annotate variants**: Link variants back to the CIViC database to annotate sample for clinical relevance.
