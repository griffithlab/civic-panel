--------------
What is CIViC?
--------------
The Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer (CIViC) database is an open
access, open source, community-driven web resource that captures clinically
relevant variants in cancer. CIViC is built on evidence statements, whereby
each statement summarizes variant actionability described by a publication.
These evidence statements are summarized at the variant level and also at the
gene level. An example of this hierarchy has been provided:

* **Evidence Statement**- Osimertinib has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC.
* **Variant** - T790M
* **Gene** - EGFR

Below we have provided a screencast entitled, `CIViC - Getting Started <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vr0BDUKkDeI>`_.
This screencast covers:
* Description of CIViC and its goals
* Navigating through CIViC's core pages
* Browsing, searching, and consuming knowledgebase content

CIViC Resources
---------------

We have provided a variety of resources to introduce users to the CIVIC database. Please review the following for more information about CIViC and the CIViC team:

* `Nature Genetics Publication <https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3774>`_
* `CIViC Help Documents <https://civicdb.org/help/introduction>`_
* `CIViC Glossary <https://civicdb.org/glossary>`_
* `API Documentation <https://griffithlab.github.io/civic-api-docs/>`_

If you have further issues or need to report a problem, feel free to email the
CIViC team at `help@civicdb.org <help@civicdb.org>`_

Contributing to CIViC
---------------------
Any user can browse or search existing curation within the database. However,
users must create a username and log-in to contribute to CIViC. Different types
of contributions can be found under
`Example Activities <https://civicdb.org/help/getting-started/example-activities>`_
on the CIViC help pages. These activities include:

* Adding evidence,
* Contributing to variant or gene summaries
* Editing CIViC content
* Adding assertions
* Other ‘bite-size’ curation tasks.

Once a change is submitted to the CIViC database it will become visible.
However, the object will be listed as a “suggested change” until it is
accepted by an editor. CIViC editors must have attained a sufficient
degree of education, the must be extensively familiar with the CIViC interface,
have a demonstrated track record for successful curation within the database,
and must be approved by two existing editorial members. More information on
becoming an editor can be found on the
`Becoming an Editor Help Docs <https://civicdb.org/help/editor>`_. An example
of how an evidence item becomes accepted into CIViC is shown below:

TO-DO: INSERT IMAGE

Regardless of curator status, each activity is recorded in the database.
Revision history can be viewed for all items within CIViC and personal
contributions can be viewed on an individual’s user profile. To promote user
activity, CIViC badges can be earned for various curation actions and the
`Community Leaderboards <https://civicdb.org/community/main>`_ show top
activity in CIViC parsed by activity type.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Adding Evidence Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The main activity in CIViC surrounds adding and editing evidence statements.
Below we have provided a screencast entitled,
`Adding CIViC Evidence <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od5Tgdfo6Qs>`_ to walk
users through creating an evidence item in CIViC. This screencast covers:

* Scanning a publication for curatable details
* Signing into CIViC to Add Evidence
* Walking through the Add Evidence form
* Viewing the submitted evidence

Editing entities in CIViC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Any item in the CIViC interface can be edited using the pencil icon. TO DO: insert pencil icon
Below we have provided a screencast entitled, “Editing entities in CIViC”
to walk users through editing item (i.e., evidence items, variants, or genes,
etc.)  in CIViC. This screencast covers:

* Navigating to an entity's Edit Form
* Importance of edit comments
* Identifying entities with pending changes
* Navigating to an entity's suggested changes
* Reviewing entity revisions
