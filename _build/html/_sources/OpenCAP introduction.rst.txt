OpenCAP introduction
====================

The Open-sourced CIViC Annotation Pipeline (OpenCAP) is a tutorial that provides users with a method to develop a customized capture panel for which the variants contained within the panel are linked to clinical relevance summaries in the CIViC knowledgebase. This tutorial contains four chapters:

- **Build Custom Capture Panel**: In this section we will use the CIViC interface to identify variants of interest for custom capture. The interface will then be used to download variants of interest, associated clinical descriptions, and curated coordinates. We will then open an interactive jupyter notebook to format the variant coordinates for probe development. The output from this exercise will be a file that is compatible with commercial probe development companies for custom panel development.


- **Sequence Samples**: Prospectively employ custom capture reagents on tumor samples for enriched capture of variants of interest.


- **Identify Somatic Variants**: Call variants from tumor-normal sequencing data.


- **Annotate Variants**: Link variants back to the CIViC database to annotate sample for clinical relevance.
