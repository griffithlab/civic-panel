Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.\", \"gene_id\"=>20, \"type\"=>\"variant\", \"variant_types\"=>[{\"id\"=>123, \"name\"=>\"transcript_amplification\", \"display_name\"=>\"Transcript Amplification\", \"so_id\"=>\"SO:0001889\", \"description\"=>\"A feature amplification of a region containing a transcript.\", \"url\"=>\"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001889\"}], \"civic_actionability_score\"=>822.5, \"coordinates\"=>{\"chromosome\"=>\"17\", \"start\"=>37856333, \"stop\"=>37884915, \"reference_bases\"=>nil, \"variant_bases\"=>nil, \"representative_transcript\"=>\"ENST00000269571.5\", \"chromosome2\"=>nil, \"start2\"=>nil, \"stop2\"=>nil, \"representative_transcript2\"=>nil, \"ensembl_version\"=>75, \"reference_build\"=>\"GRCh37\"}, \"variant_url\"=>\"/events/genes/20/summary/variants/306/summary#variant\", \"evidence_items\"=>[{\"id\"=>1011, \"name\"=>\"EID1011\", \"description\"=>\"This Phase II trial (LUX-Breast 3 - NCT01441596) compared afatinib, afatinib plus vinorelbine, or investigator's choice of treatment.  121 patients with HER2 overexpressing breast cancer with CNS recurrence or regression who had previously progressed on trastuzumab or lapatinib were assigned to 3 arms, with endpoint in the intention-to-treat population being patient benefit at 12 weeks defined as absence of CNS or extra CNS progression, no tumor related worsening of neurological symptoms and no increase in corticosteroid dose.

Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.\", \"gene_id\"=>19, \"type\"=>\"variant\", \"variant_types\"=>[{\"id\"=>47, \"name\"=>\"missense_variant\", \"display_name\"=>\"Missense Variant\", \"so_id\"=>\"SO:0001583\", \"description\"=>\"A sequence variant, that changes one or more bases, resulting in a different amino acid sequence but where the length is preserved.\", \"url\"=>\"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001583\"}], \"civic_actionability_score\"=>314.5, \"coordinates\"=>{\"chromosome\"=>\"7\", \"start\"=>55259515, \"stop\"=>55259515, \"reference_bases\"=>\"T\", \"variant_bases\"=>\"G\", \"representative_transcript\"=>\"ENST00000275493.2\", \"chromosome2\"=>nil, \"start2\"=>nil, \"stop2\"=>nil, \"representative_transcript2\"=>nil, \"ensembl_version\"=>75, \"reference_build\"=>\"GRCh37\"}, \"variant_url\"=>\"/events/genes/19/summary/variants/33/summary#variant\", \"evidence_items\"=>[{\"id\"=>229, \"name\"=>\"EID229\", \"description\"=>\"There is no statistical difference in progression free survival between lung cancer patients treated with gefitinib or erlotinib with EGFR L858R mutations (N=72/242; univariate: P=0.283; multivariate: P=0.250) compared to patients with Exon 19 mutations (N=170).\", \"disease\"=>{\"id\"=>8, \"name\"=>\"Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma\", \"display_name\"=>\"Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma\", \"doid\"=>\"3908\", \"url\"=>\"http://www.disease-ontology.org/?id=DOID:3908\"}, \"drugs\"=>[{\"id\"=>14, \"name\"=>\"Gefitinib\", \"pubchem_id\"=>nil}, {\"id\"=>15, \"name\"=>\"Erlotinib\", \"pubchem_id\"=>nil}], \"rating\"=>3, \"evidence_level\"=>\"B\", \"evidence_type\"=>\"Predictive\", \"clinical_significance\"=>\"Sensitivity\", \"evidence_direction\"=>\"Supports\", \"variant_origin\"=>\"Somatic Mutation\", \"drug_interaction_type\"=>\"Substitutes\", \"status\"=>\"accepted\", \"open_change_count\"=>0, \"type\"=>\"evidence\", \"source\"=>{\"id\"=>162, \"name\"=>\"Comparison of clinical outcomes following gefitinib and erlotinib treatment in non-small-cell lung cancer patients harboring an epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in either exon 19 or 21.\", \"citation\"=>\"Lim et al., 2014, J Thorac Oncol\", \"pubmed_id\"=>\"24736073\", \"source_url\"=>\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736073\", \"open_access\"=>nil, \"pmc_id\"=>nil, \"publication_date\"=>{\"year\"=>2014, \"month\"=>4}, \"journal\"=>\"J Thorac Oncol\", \"full_journal_title\"=>\"Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer\", \"status\"=>\"fully curated\", \"is_review\"=>false, \"clinical_trials\"=>[]}, \"variant_id\"=>33, \"phenotypes\"=>[]}, {\"id\"=>4284, \"name\"=>\"EID4284\", \"description\"=>\"In an in vitro study using NCI-H1666 cells (wildtype EGFR) and NCI-H3255 cells (EGFR-L858R), inhibition of cell growth was used as an assay to determine sensitivity to reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs.

In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant.

large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. \\n\\nIn a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. \\n\\nDue to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.   \\n\\nALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial.

In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant.

large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. \\n\\nIn a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. \\n\\nDue to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.   \\n\\nALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.\", \"gene_id\"=>1, \"type\"=>\"variant\", \"variant_types\"=>[{\"id\"=>120, \"name\"=>\"transcript_fusion\", \"display_name\"=>\"Transcript Fusion\", \"so_id\"=>\"SO:0001886\", \"description\"=>\"A feature fusion where the deletion brings together transcript regions.\", \"url\"=>\"http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_svn/term/SO:0001886\"}], \"civic_actionability_score\"=>440.5, \"coordinates\"=>{\"chromosome\"=>\"2\", \"start\"=>29415640, \"stop\"=>29446394, \"reference_bases\"=>nil, \"variant_bases\"=>nil, \"representative_transcript\"=>\"ENST00000389048.3\", \"chromosome2\"=>nil, \"start2\"=>nil, \"stop2\"=>nil, \"representative_transcript2\"=>nil, \"ensembl_version\"=>75, \"reference_build\"=>\"GRCh37\"}, \"variant_url\"=>\"/events/genes/1/summary/variants/499/summary#variant\", \"evidence_items\"=>[{\"id\"=>4858, \"name\"=>\"EID4858\", \"description\"=>\"In a randomized, open-label phase 3 trial 303 patients with ALK-positive, previously untreated NSCLC (including asympt.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial.
